1. Does your program run the same way each time? Why?

No, because the threads are in race conditions, Meaning they will run differently each time the program is executed.

2. Give your last customer thread the highest priority. Does this ensure that this customer is always given first priority? Why or why not?

No, it does not. This is because higher priority threads can wait behind a lower priority thread if the lower thread holds a lock or sempahore that the higher priority thread is waiting for.
